## Core Features

### üéØ Automated Job Applications
- Automatically applies to 10+ relevant jobs per user per day (Monday-Friday)
- Intelligent job matching within 30-mile radius
- Multi-method application: API ‚Üí File Upload ‚Üí Text Fallback

### üß† Experience Classification
- Smart calculation: Work Experience + Education Credits
- Level classification: Entry (<3 years), Mid (3-8 years), Senior (>8 years)
- Direct vs indirect work experience weighting

### üìÑ Resume Management
- Multiple upload formats (PDF/DOCX)
- Automatic parsing and text extraction
- Secure AWS S3 storage with encryption

### üîç Job Matching Algorithm
- Skills match (50%) + Experience alignment (30%) + Education (20%)
- Location-based filtering with PostGIS
- Real-time job board integration (Indeed, Monster)
